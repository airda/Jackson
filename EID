<p>Jackson is my 120-pound baby. He's an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bulldog">American Bulldog.</a>

    <p>When I moved to Toronto, I had to leave Jackson back in Colorado. I miss him more than I miss my friends. Sometimes we Skype, but he's been known to pee when he gets too excited, and this has been a problem every time we've chatted.</p>
    <p> Someday I hope to fly Jackson out to Toronto, if only for a visit. For now, he's happy to roam the Rocky Mountains, bask in the Colorado sun (in a backyard that I could never afford in this city), and chew on sticks.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Jackson Ezekiel is an Original Gangster.</p>
